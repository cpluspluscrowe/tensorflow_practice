- copied and pasted a lot of info into the introductions chapter.
  - there will be some duplication I'll want to remove.   
- differentiate between the marketing funnel and the secondary approach with user engagements.
** Note that Dr. Hall left comments on V1.
- address these in V2
* Graph Goals for next week
** TODO Visualize member state + engagement = final state
** TODO spend more time iterating on the relative sizes
- might do this one manually too.   
** TODO create graph (manually) showing movement between clusters.
** TODO improve labels on the existing graphs (and communication of the data)   
* Stretch goals for this week
** TODO address Dr. Haas' comments on the paper too     
** sankey diagram to show movement from cluster 0 to other clusters

* Notes
- Dr. Haas uploaded a v2 of the paper.
- Having it in this structure helps with streamlining.  Some duplication exists.
** put all initial data into the intro chapter
** TODO work through the theory aspects that Dr. Hall sent to me over email.
