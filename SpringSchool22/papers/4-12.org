*** Notes
- note how cluster 3 and 9 are the same in their top metrics, it is the number of clicks that distinguishes the two.
- a lot of other engagements, there might be overlap.
- this is before objective type as far as I know.       
** TODO name what the cluster transitions represent.
   
** TODO write down the major engagements that cause this engagement change.
