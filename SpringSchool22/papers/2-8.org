# 2-8-22 Meeting
* Current Paper
** DONE visualize content this week
   CLOSED: [2022-02-22 Tue 07:29]
*** DONE list the possible visualizations
    CLOSED: [2022-02-22 Tue 07:29]
**** DONE weight LOE vs LOI for each version.    
     CLOSED: [2022-02-22 Tue 07:29]
*** DONE Consider visualizing via a Sankey diagram for user flows through the funnel
    CLOSED: [2022-02-22 Tue 07:29]
- percentage outflow between stages
It would be super interesting to visualize this marketing funnel graphically. E.g., using a sankey diagram or similar flow diagram, visualize  how often cluster transitions occur.    
** TODO I can try to speak to the potential revenue implications.  The benefit will increase engagements by x% at each stage of the marketing funnel, which result in considerable increases in the population at latter funnel stages.

* Progress
- Need to practice statistics problems before the exam, do some later tonight.
*** DONE - need to write down ideas for possible visualizations.

- table of metrics
  - needs updating too
**** DONE add a title to the table of metrics.    
     CLOSED: [2022-02-22 Tue 07:29]
- K-means cluster chart
  - you can visualize the clusters
    - and visualize the size of movements between clusters.
**** DONE visualize the k-means clusters in relative size and their connection size
     CLOSED: [2022-02-22 Tue 07:29]
- Confidence tables for the cluster transitions precision, recall, and f-score.
  - better tables for this data
- massive table concerning the important metrics for predicting cluster transitions.
  - need a huge update on the primary predictive metrics
- update Table 7, no reason for metric 1 and metric 2 to not be more concise.
- cluster transitions, 0-7 shown.
**** DONE find cluster transitions for 8 and 9??  Maybe non-existent.

* Rejected Paper                                                    :ARCHIVE:

* Notes                                                             :ARCHIVE:
- Need to update tables, possibly translate to images or something more digestible.
- focus on the theoretical argument first.
  - 2.25 in related work. Do we feel it is a theory argument?
** DONE - it would be beneficial to approach the how and why things work, and how we respond
   CLOSED: [2022-02-17 Thu 18:54] SCHEDULED: <2022-03-08 Tue>
   - we had this meeting on Tuesday and laid out our approach
     - going to approach with a heavier theory section
** DONE - let's back into data science.
   CLOSED: [2022-02-17 Thu 18:54] SCHEDULED: <2022-02-20>
   - nope, going to stay in marketing
- we'll come back in two weeks
  - Dr. Haas will do some restructuring over the next two weeks
    - highlights that we feel the structure can be improved as-is.
- note that misq is big on theory.
  - consider bringing in committee person for the marketing science one <- add another person on the paper (only for papers in the marketing science domain).
